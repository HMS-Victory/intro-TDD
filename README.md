# intro-TDD

Really all you need to test this project is to create a python environment
and install pytest on it then enter "pytest -v" into the terminal or just "pytest"

if you do not have an environment you can download one like this.

# installation
"py -m pip install --user virtualenv"
# specify the folder to build in
"py -m virtualenv env"
# check to make sure it exists
"where python"  
# activate the env
"...\env\Scripts\python.exe"
